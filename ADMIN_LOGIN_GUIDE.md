# HRMS Admin Login Guide

## ðŸ”‘ How to Login as Admin

### Step 1: Access the Application
1. Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:3002**
2. You'll be redirected to the sign-in page

### Step 2: Create Your Admin Account
1. Click **"Sign Up"** if you don't have an account
2. Fill in your details:

   - **Password**: create a secure password
   - **First Name**: Admin

3. Complete the email verification if required by Clerk

### Step 3: Automatic User Creation
- When you sign up through Clerk, the webhook automatically creates a user in our database
- By default, new users get the **EMPLOYEE** role
- We need to manually upgrade your account to **ADMIN** role

### Step 4: Upgrade to Admin Role
After creating your account, you have a few options to become an admin:

#### Option A: Database Direct Update (Recommended for Development)
Run this SQL query in your Neon database console:

```sql
UPDATE users 
SET role = 'SUPER_ADMIN' 
WHERE email = 'your-email@domain.com';
```

#### Option B: Use Prisma Studio (Visual Database Editor)
1. Run: `npx prisma studio`
2. Open the `User` table
3. Find your user record
4. Change the `role` field from `EMPLOYEE` to `SUPER_ADMIN`
5. Save the changes

# ✅ FIXED: 2026 Jordan Holidays Now Supported

## 🎯 **ISSUE RESOLVED:**
The date picker was only configured for 2025 holidays. When trying to select **26/06/2026**, the system didn't recognize it as a holiday because:

1. **No 2026 data**: Only 2025 holidays were loaded
2. **Wrong date**: In 2026, Hijri New Year is on **June 16**, not June 26
3. **Single-year limitation**: Calendar couldn't handle multiple years
